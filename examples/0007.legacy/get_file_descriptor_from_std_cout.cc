/*
C++ iostream is a holy crap. You cannot access FILE* inside std::cout because of the OO garbage.
See an old blog: https://www.ginac.de/~kreckel/fileno/

Also see wiki in fast_io to understand how C++ std::fstream work. It is implemented by FILE*.
So why do you use iostream?? It is just a garbage quality of RAII wrapper for FILE*.
